# Introduction
The `foundation` library is designed to illustrate how to build a complete Java application development platform using (my understanding of) current best practices including:
- Docker for development environment and docker-compose for runtime execution
- Gradle for building and packaging source code
- Nomad for environment runtime and individual job management
- Fully integrated service oriented architecture -- all applications share the same base service, configuration, logging and threading model
